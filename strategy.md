# Crypto News Prediction Pipeline

## Overview
This project aims to **predict cryptocurrency price fluctuations** in real-time by analyzing **global news sentiment**. The pipeline will detect major news events and estimate how they will impact crypto prices, allowing for fast trading decisions.

## Core Strategy
- **Real-time news ingestion**: Scrape and process news from major sources (NewsAPI, Twitter, CryptoPanic).
- **Sentiment analysis**: Use NLP models to determine if the news is positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Crypto price tracking**: Fetch real-time crypto prices from Binance, Coinbase, or Alpha Vantage.
- **Machine learning model**: Train predictive models (LSTM, transformer models) to forecast price movements.
- **Automated execution**: Send buy/sell signals to a trading bot based on prediction confidence.

## Technology Stack
- **News Ingestion**: `NewsAPI`, `Twitter API`, `CryptoPanic API`
- **Data Storage**: `AWS S3`, `DynamoDB`
- **Processing & Modeling**: `Amazon SageMaker`, `Hugging Face Transformers`
- **Automation**: `Apache Airflow`, `AWS Lambda`
- **Trading Execution**: `Binance API`, `Coinbase API`
- **Dashboard**: `Amazon QuickSight` or `Streamlit`

## Project Workflow
1. **Extract News**: 
   - Scrape news using APIs (NewsAPI, Twitter, CryptoPanic)
   - Store raw data in S3
   
2. **Analyze Sentiment**: 
   - Use NLP models (Amazon Comprehend / Hugging Face)
   - Assign sentiment scores (-1 to +1)
   
3. **Track Crypto Prices**: 
   - Fetch real-time price data from Binance/Coinbase API
   - Store time-series data in DynamoDB/S3

4. **Predict Market Impact**: 
   - Train ML models on news + price data
   - Forecast price movements

5. **Trade Execution**: 
   - If confidence threshold is met, trigger trade bot
   - Store executed trade data for future learning

## Next Steps
- ✅ Set up GitHub repo
- ⏳ Implement real-time news extraction
- ⏳ Store data in AWS S3
- ⏳ Develop sentiment analysis pipeline
- ⏳ Train predictive model in SageMaker
- ⏳ Automate execution via trading bot
